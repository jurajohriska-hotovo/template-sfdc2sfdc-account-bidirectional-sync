<![CDATA[
This template sets an online bi-directional sync of accounts between two Salesforce instances with ability to specify filtering criteria.
The main behavior of this template is fetching data for changes (new or modified accounts) using scheduler or the HTTP component that have occurred in any of the Salesforce instances during a certain defined period of time. For those accounts that both have not been updated yet, the integration triggers an upsert (update or create depending the case) taking the last modification as the one that should be applied.

<![CDATA[
To make this template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made for all to run smoothly.
Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.

To have your application up and running you just need to complete two simple steps:

 1. Configure the application properties.
 2. Run it on premises or in CloudHub.

Fill in all properties in one of the property files, for example in mule.dev.properties, and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this is `mule.env=dev`.

#### Application Configuration

+ http.port `9090`

+ scheduler.frequency `10000`  
This are the milliseconds that will run between two different checks for updates in either Salesforce instance

+ scheduler.startDelay `0`

+ watermark.default.expression `2018-02-25T11:00:00.000Z`  
This property is an important one, as it configures what should be the start point of the synchronization. If the use case includes synchronization of every 
account created from the begining of the times, you should use a date previous to any account creation (perhaphs `1900-01-01T08:00:00.000Z` is a good choice). 
If you want to synchronize the accounts created from now on, then you should use a default value according to that requirement (for example, 
if today is April 21st of 2018 and it's eleven o'clock in London, then you could use the following value `2018-04-21T11:00:00.000Z`).

+ page.size `1000`

+ trigger.policy `push` | `poll`
**Note:** the property **trigger.policy** can take any of the three following values:
+ **empty_value**: if the propety has no value assigned to it then application will do nothing in what respect to the account.
+ **poll**: the Scheduler trigger flow will be used
+ **push**: the Push Notification trigger flow will be used


#### SalesForce Connector Configuration for Company A

+ sfdc.a.username `jorge.drexler@mail.com`
+ sfdc.a.password `Noctiluca123`
+ sfdc.a.securityToken `avsfwCUl7apQs56Xq2AKi3X`
+ sfdc.a.integration.user.id `A0ed000BO9T`

	**Note:** To find  the correct *sfdc.a.integration.user.id* value, refer to the example project **Salesforce Data Retrieval** in Anypoint Exchange.

#### SalesForce Connector Configuration for Company B

+ sfdc.b.username `mariano.cozzi@mail.com`
+ sfdc.b.password `LaRanitaDeLaBicicleta456`
+ sfdc.b.securityToken `ces56arl7apQs56XTddf34X`
+ sfdc.b.integration.user.id `B0ed000BO9T`

	**Note:** To find the correct *sfdc.b.integration.user.id* value, refer to the example project **Salesforce Data Retrieval** in Anypoint Exchange.
